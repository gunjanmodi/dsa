# DS & Algorithms Solutions

Welcome to my "DS & Algorithms Solutions" repository! This repository is a collection of my solutions to various problems related to data structures and algorithms.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to serve as a personal reference and revision resource for me. However, I also created it with the intention of sharing my solutions with the community and providing a resource for other developers and programmers who are interested in improving their understanding of these concepts.

## Contents

The solutions in this repository are written in a variety of programming languages, including Python and Java. The problems cover a wide range of topics, including sliding window, two pointers, sorting and searching algorithms, linked lists, trees, graphs, heaps, DFS, BFS, divide & conquer and more. The repository is constantly updated with new solutions and improvements.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are always welcome! If you would like to submit your own solutions or improvements to existing solutions, please feel free to open a pull request.
