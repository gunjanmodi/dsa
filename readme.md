# Data Structures and Algorithms Solutions

Welcome to my Git repository of data structures and algorithms solutions! Here, you will find well-tested implementations of common algorithms, all developed using the Test Driven Development (TDD) approach. Each solution includes a set of tests to verify its correctness and ensure that it meets the specified requirements.

## Why TDD?

By following the TDD methodology, I have strived to write clean and maintainable code that is easy to understand and modify. TDD is a software development practice that involves writing tests before writing code. This approach has several benefits, including:

- Ensuring that the code meets the requirements and is of high quality
- Facilitating code maintenance and modifications
- Reducing the likelihood of bugs and defects
- Increasing productivity and efficiency

## How to use this repository

This repository serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning or practicing data structures and algorithms. You can browse through the different folders to find solutions to specific problems, or search for a particular algorithm or data structure.

To run the tests for a particular solution, navigate to the solution's folder and run the following command:

```
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```
