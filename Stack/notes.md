Stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).

### How to identify stack questions?

1. Generally when Array Time Complexity appears O(n^2), and want to reduce it to O(n)
2. Brute Force is of the type:
    for( int i = 0 to i = n) :
        for (int j dependent on i) :
            end
        end
